      h5.services__subtitle Comparison between StudyMoose plagiarism checker and SafeAssign checker

      p.page__text StudyMoose's Plagiarism Checker is both free and easy to use. It is not so with all plagiarism checkers offered online. For instance, the SafeAssign online plagiarism checker makes it difficult to understand where exactly one should upload the paper. If there are difficulties with the similarity index, a student might order online help on Studymoose, while SafeAssign for students free cannot offer any help. Also, it may be better to use StudyMoose rather than SafeAssign as professors also utilize our tool. Thus, after checking the paper here you can be 100% sure that no new plagiarism issues will appear when your teacher examines it too.
